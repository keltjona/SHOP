Java Supermarket App

    About

This Java Supermarket App is a sophisticated yet user-friendly application designed to streamline supermarket operations, featuring distinct interfaces for cashiers and administrators. Developed with precision and a deep understanding of supermarket needs, it aims to enhance efficiency, sales tracking, and customer management. 
While the creators of this project poured extensive effort and creativity into its development, humorously noting, the compensation might not reflect the immense value it brings to the table.
